# lead-latinoamerica

## Purpose
* Lead LatinoAmerica is a web application meant to help parents and students navigate the often difficult to find world of resources. 
* It is meant to be a compendium of sorts, helping find not only scholarships, but any program, internship or summer opportunity. 
* Another issue that's common that Lead is attempting to solve is that a lot of students who need help, 
may be in a household where a parent is unable to help research because it's not in their native language.
