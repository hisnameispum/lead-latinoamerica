/*
  SAMPLE OBJECT 
  {
    key: "value",
  },
  
  The key has no quotes, followed by a colon, and the value has " " marks around it. 
  The line is finished with a comma, and then go on to the next line. 
  
  things that start with [] are arrays, they start with [ and then input a string that are comma separated ie
  ["string1", "string2", "string3"],
  
  edge cases
  If you want to use an " in a word, please use an escape character first which is \
  So it would look like "I\"m going to code for fun".
  
  You can fill out this templatized object below.
